# **Remote-Weather-Station**
## Description: 
This project's objective is to build a remote weather station to that has the ability to operate in remote areas without cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connection using long range radio communication such as Lo-Ra.
## Sensors and Components:
1. RFM95 433MHz Lo-Ra Radio Module
2. SHTC3 Digital Temeprature and Humidity Sensor
3. BMP338 Barometric Pressure Sensor
4. SGP40 Air Quality Sensor
5. Analog UV Sensor
6. DS3231 RTC Module
7. SSD1351 OLED Module
8. Adafruit Industries Feather M0
## Comments:
- Experiments 1 to 8 are the gradual steps that were took to build the prototype (v0.99).
- Since we are now working with a new microcontroller, the entire code needs to be reworked. However, use the previous code as a guide to help you develop your code.
